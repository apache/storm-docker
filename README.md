# Docker image packaging for Apache Storm

This is the Git repo of the [Docker "Official Image"](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#what-are-official-images) for [`storm`](https://hub.docker.com/_/storm/), which is now maintained by the Apache Storm PMC.

See [the Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/storm/) for the full README on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The [full image description on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/storm/) is generated/maintained over in [the docker-library/docs repository](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [the `storm` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/storm).
